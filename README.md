# Welcome to our Cardano e-commerce integration project

This project aims to build Cardano integrations with [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=univocity) 
and enable online shops and customers to exchange ADA for goods with 0 fees and commissions.

We are going to release and maintain an official [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=univocity) app, which will be immediately 
accessible to more than 500,000 online businesses around the world. Our hope
is to slowly introduce Cardano into this marketplace - which currently generates
around 870K dollars per minute in sales.

In the interest of decentralization, more advanced users will be able to build and deploy 
this project to their own servers and run the Cardano integration app in their own stores,
independently of the official app we are going to release.

Source code and documentation will start to flow on as soon as the `SHOP` pool starts
generating rewards on the cardano mainnet.  

There is a lot of development to be done. Please come back and check this 
repository weekly to see what's happening.

We will investigate how to enable integration with other online stores backed by other platforms
such as Magento, BigCommerce, etc once the [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=univocity) app is ready for production.

> "We are Cardano, and if you'll permit us, we'd like to change the world."

## Supporting our project

This is an open-source, not for profit initiative, and we are looking for support
from the community through:

 * stake pool delegation: simply delegate your ADA to our stake pool **`SHOP`**. Fees on
  rewards produced by the **`SHOP`** pool will be used to help financing the long term
  development and maintenance of this project, and others to come.
  
 * **<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/sponsors/jbax" data-icon="octicon-heart" aria-label="Sponsor @jbax on GitHub">sponsoring</a>** me here on github.

 * **direct donations**, via:
  
   * **Paypal** - just click [![paypal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=JKH3JNHLL4Y42&source=url) 
   
   * **ADA**: on `addr1qy77cfgccmcfe9h936qunl4u36hyrwryrmzj6duug9sm73tdd0sqyslnjxvce9syyw4ktnrh0n7ct60zrs29wnef3jqq202748`
   
   * **Bitcoin**: on `3BcmUPTPfLDuYWWSBxGKkChkq5WMzC94J6`

     * **[Coinmama](https://go.coinmama.com/visit/?bta=56730&brand=coinmama)** for buying
        and selling ADA among other crypto currencies. This is not an exchange and you get your tokens pretty fast.
   
     * **[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=36767892)** for trading - 
        and if you can code you can even build automated trading robots for binance
        using my other project [univocity-trader](https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-trader)

 
Every little bit helps. Thank you for your support!
