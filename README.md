# Welcome to the Cardano e-commerce integration project, sponsored by the *_SHOP_* stake pool. 

This project aims to build Cardano integrations with e-commerce and enable 
online shops and customers to exchange ADA for goods with ZERO fees and 
commissions.

Initially, we are going to release and maintain an official
[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=univocity)  app, which will be 
immediately accessible to more than 500,000 online businesses 
around the world who generate 800 million dollars per minute in sales.

We are also creating an e-commerce friendly wallet to better support
business needs of online stores that trade in higher volumes. Refer
to the [free-commerce](https://github.com/uniVocity/free-commerce) project
to learn more.

Once smart contracts become available, we'll introduce support for subscriptions 
and recurring payments in ADA and native tokens that run on the Cardano 
blockchain.

The code is fully open-sourced and more advanced users will be able to 
customize, build and deploy it to their own servers.

After [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=univocity), we will move on to
build integrations with other large e-commerce platforms such as Woocommerce 
for WordPress, Magento, etc.

Source code and documentation will be available here on this GitHub repository,
and the work has [already begun](https://github.com/uniVocity/shopify/commits/master)!

## Delegate to the **SHOP** pool to help expand the cardano ecosystem!

We want to offer everything for free to help with the adoption of Cardano as 
viable payment gateway for everyone.
 
Pool fees will help to support the development and maintenance of our e-commerce
integrations, which depend on servers to be online, certificates to be paid, and
other constant running costs.

### The **SHOP** pool has:

 - **580K ADA pledged**. We are committed not only to expand the adoption of Cardano in the e-commerce space, but also committed to ensure it's decentralized. We are here to stay and not going anywhere.
 
 - **1.74% fees**. On top of great rewards you'll also help increase the value 
of every ADA you own through greater adoption.  

## Other ways of supporting our project

As an open-source, not for profit initiative, we are looking for support
from the community not only through stake pool delegation. You can also:

     * **[Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=36767892)** for trading - 
        and if you can code you can even build automated trading robots for binance
        using my other project [univocity-trader](https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-trader)
 
Every little bit helps. Thank you for your support!
